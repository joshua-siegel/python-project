## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. Budget Tracker / Asset Manager / FIRE Retirement Prototype
   A platform that tracks monthly customized budgets, allows you to manually track your asset/investment appreciation from your budget savings, and calculates the assets needed to retire with a given withdrawal rate and given lifestyle based on your budget.  Could also extrapolate investment growth to tell you when you are likely to reach FIRE.
2. coffee recommender
   For people who are indecisive and donâ€™t know what they want at a cafe. The program will ask if the user wants it hot/iced, tea or coffee, (y/n) to black, sweetness level (1-5), etc. It will return one or multiple recommendations to the user. 
3. Blackjack
   The user will be playing against the computer. The game will continuously restart until the user indicates they do not want to play another round.
