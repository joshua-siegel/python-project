# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

RatSlapper 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This is a digital version of the card game "Egyptian Ratscrew (ERS)"

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This software simulates the card came ERS using a digital GUI running on PyGame.  A user has the option to play against one or more bots or against other players on the same computer.  The user can also customize the game to their preferred mode, choosing easy, medium, or hard against the bots for example, or by choosing certain rules to play with.  The number of players/bots is also customizeable.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
Ok.
Rules: Add to 10, sandwich (Default = 1 card in between, New Rule = exactly 2 cards in between), marriage, divorce, top bottom, etc.
Sandwich: 5 7 5
Sandwich Modification: 5 7 8 5
Super Sandwich Modification: 5 3 7 9 4 5

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Our basic outcome is to develop a game where either two players can play ERS on the same computer within a given set of rules, or a single player can play against a bot wihin the given set of rules.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

On top of the good outcome, a better outcome would allow a player to choose the amount of players and bots to add to the game, and for the bots, the player can also set the difficulty mode.  Before starting the game, the player can also choose which rules to play keep and which rules to disregard, and the player can choose whether to set a time limit for drawing cards (blitz mode).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

On top of the better outcome, the best outcome would allow the player to modify existing rules (e.g. adding hoagies (2 cards in between) to sandwich slaps (1 card in between), two cards adding to 8 or 10, or 8 instead of 10, etc.).  Players can modify the deck size (e.g. adding more face cards to weight the game towards multi-draws, or removing them altogether so players can only rely on slaps).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, we will need to learn PyGame in order to get a better understanding on how video game logic and GUI logic can be applied to ERS.  We will need to research timing as well as how to create a game with different players trying to achieve the same objective, including bot players.  For the best outcome, we might need to learn how to make certain rule functions flexible based on user input on a GUI, or to allow them to modify a list of cards if they decide to modify the deck.

Because we are both new to PyGame, we do not know hot to split the work yet. Once we gain a better understanding of the scope of the project and PyGame, then we will be able to have a more clear view on how the work will be divided.
